# DatabaseManagementSQL
ISDS 7510 Project


In your assigned group, you will develop a data model for an application to be determined with the instructor. Review
existing apps and exercise your creativity to determine the data model's entities. You will convert your team’s data model
to a relational database, populate the tables, write queries of the database, and analyze the data from your database and
generate meaningful analytic report. 

Purple & Gold Consultants, specialize in enchancing businesses' tech operations. Recently, we gained a new client, Snip’s. Snip’s is a virtual salon/barber client who has asked us to create an application platform to connect with clients so that stylists may provide mobile service(s) to customers. Snip’s is a mobile salon/barber service provider, which contracts licensed stylists who can bring their service(s) to the client, instead of the traditional business model of enforcing the client to travel to them to receive such service(s). To begin the deployment of Snip’s new application, we must create a database. Below, we have attached our working model of the new database for Snip’s.
